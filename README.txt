I have included the embedding file, the vocabulary file, and the files for the best model from each section, such that some of the results 
mentioned in the report can be checked, if needed. This is due to some reproducibility issues (likely a bug) when restarting the Jupyter 
kernel, resulting in minor differences in the data during preprocessing, even though we do seeding.
